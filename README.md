Scripts for article management


ISSUES
======

1. The renaming scripts do not handle very well the case of duplicate files in the same directory. Investigate.

2. The crossref.org json responses seem to occasionally change the short Journal title resulting in constand renaming of certain files. Investigate.
    - One possibility is to simply use the full Journal title and convert it to a standard shorted version using a table.

3. Move processed files in a Processed directory?

4. Collect BibTex records in a file.
